    "    The purpose of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, as in other programming languages, is to organize code into reusable and maintainable components called objects. OOP in Python is based on the concept of classes and objects, where a class defines a blueprint for creating objects, and objects are instances of a class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are several benefits of using OOP in Python, including:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so \n",
    "        that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the \n",
    "        use of objects\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4. Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5. Multiple instances of an object can be made.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Encapsulation: OOP allows you to group data and functions that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. This encapsulation helps to reduce complexity and increase modularity by hiding implementation details and exposing a clean interface for working with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: OOP allows you to create abstract classes that define a set of methods without providing an implementation. This abstraction allows you to create a common interface for a group of related objects, making it easier to create new objects that share common behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance: OOP allows you to create new classes by inheriting attributes and methods from existing classes. This inheritance promotes code reuse and allows you to create specialized classes that build on the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism: OOP allows you to create objects that can take on many different forms or types. This polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types without having to know the specific type at compile  \n",
    "    time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, OOP in Python provides a powerful and flexible way to create complex programs that are easy to maintain and \n",
    "    extend over time."

    "\n",
